Design Considerations
=====================

1.	itead studio, my preferred PCB manufacturers, offer good value BUT limit the PCB to
	5cm x 10cm. Final product must fit inside that area.

2.	Most of the bottom is a ground plane.  In later versions, other circuits could be
	added to this area. 

3.	expansion ideas include: USB interface, power supply, battery charger.
