Version 2C:
----------
There are now 2 distinct layouts.
#1:	49 Keys, 100mm x 50mm board.
	10 x 5 buttons, with one "double-width" button on bottom row.
	This board, when combined with a large LCD, would be in a typical
	"clamshell" layout, similar to a laptop.

#2:	47 Keys, 100mm x 60mm board.
	2 rows, 4 buttons wide [8 total].
	4 rows, 10 buttons wide, with one "double-width" button on bottom row [39 total].
	This board has a "cutout" area, allowing a smaller LCD to be added to the top.
	"Landscape" layout, similar to a HP 15C

Version #2 is also being developed as an Android app, using the Nexus 7.
